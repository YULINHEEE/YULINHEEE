Hi, I’m Yulin He!

My main focus is on data analytics, including data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series forecasting.

I’m keen to collaborate on projects that connect data science with sustainability and social impact.

Currently learning advanced analytics techniques and always excited to try new tools in Python and R.
